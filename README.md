# BuildingGenerator
My bachelor's thesis, a nodegraph-based generator for all kinds of buildings.

## Warnings

This Blender plugin is for a VERY old version of Blender (2.71) and features a bug I never found a solution to:
When loading a .blend file with a "Building" type nodegraph in it, changing anything inside the graph without clicking on "update" first will crash Blender immediately, without any dumps or logs available.

## Installing

Simply download the zip and load it from inside Blender's plugin manager.
